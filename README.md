# -console-based-To-Do-List-application-in-Python
This is a simple command-line To-Do List Manager built using Python. It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks directly from the terminal. All tasks are stored persistently in a text file using Python's file handling features, enabling the task list to remain available between sessions.


The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as:

File handling (open(), read/write modes)

List manipulation (append(), remove(), insert())

Looping and conditionals

String processing (strip(), formatting)

Context managers (with statement)

This project was created as part of a Python Developer Internship task focused on building real-world applications using core Python.
